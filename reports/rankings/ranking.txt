How Rankings Were Determined:

I calculated monthly sentiment scores for each employee based on their communication data (Task 3).
For each month, the top-performing employees were selected by:

Sorting by sentiment score (descending)

Using alphabetical order of employee emails to break ties
We then classified employees into "Top Positive" and "Top Negative" rankings.
The results were saved as a structured dataset for further analysis and visualization.
